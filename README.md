# **Data Structures**

> Data structures are used to store, manage and access data quickly and efficiently.

## Data Structures _currently_ implemented in this repository _using C_:-

- **LINKED LIST:** Linked list is implemented with operations like:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Traversing
  
  With one application i.e. polynomial representation using linked list.

- **STACK:** Stack is implemented using array and linked list with basic stacks operations like:
  - Pop
  - Push
  - Peek 
  
  With several applications like:
  - Reversing a list
  - Expression validator
  - Prefix to postfix and vice versa
  - Prefix and postfix expression evaluation

- **QUEUE:** Queue is implemented using array and linked list with basic queue operations like:
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Peek
  - Display.

- **BINARY SEARCH TREE:** BST is implemented with operations like:
  - Insertion
  - Traversal(pre-order, in-order and post-order)
  - Deletion
  - Finding smallest and largest element
  - Counting number of total, internal and external nodes
